I.M.P. business, bitch you know
Family first till the end of the road
I got shooters, I got looters, I got hoes
All around the motherfucking globe
First class flights, helluva life
Bark, bark, bark, helluva bite
Even in hell, taking no L's, never a loss
Counting money 'til I die, helluva boss

Ain't nothing wrong here
But my feelings are strong here, like I don't belong here
Mm-hmm
But it's been so long here
Since I wrote this song here, now we get along here
Mm-hmm
Prepared for assassination
So I can get vaccinated, 'cause you know my ass is patient
Mm-hmm
Feeling the wrath of Satan
The way that it hurts, it really ain't worth it, getting infatuated
Mm-hmm
I've been noticing these
Broke kids on that faux shit, woe isn't me
Flow sick, this is COVID quarantine dreams
Whole click get your dome split, mostly Millie
Let's go
Count up the dollars
Fuck that impoverished squalor 'cause we get dough
Making them holla, sending em out to Valhalla, the creed's ten toes
Down on the solid, Moxxie just got me a rocket and he said "Blow!"
Goddamn, goddamn, I'm just here for the free payroll

I.M.P. business, bitch you know
Family first till the end of the road
I got shooters, I got looters, I got hoes
All around the motherfucking globe
First class flights, helluva life
Bark, bark, bark, helluva bite
Even in hell, taking no L's, never a loss
Counting money 'til I die, helluva boss

The "o" is silent
I never like when the crickets in my bank account try to speak for me
Know that I've been in Stolas' eyelids for
Only one night, thank the Gods I can easily
Take the high route and fix the dry mouth
Go sip on some wine, maybe down it more frequently
Go unconscious and hit rewind then get
Back to the grind, baby, I need no sympathy
Easy come and easy go, cop a body, heave and ho, yuh
Little high and little low, profit off illegal notes, yuh
Either way the wind blows, I just wanna see my queen grow
Either way the wind blows, I just wanna see my queen grow
This is the family business I'm in charge of
Life gets wild just like my daughter
Don't bring light to my disorderly conduct
It's kinda obvious why Moxxie need watchers
I lift my lids off of Millie and lost a million dollars
And also almost lost Millie, I gotta father for really
You gotta hop off my daughter's box, Moxxie's block and my willy
Get a couple more kills and we can pay a couple more bills
Then maybe we can finally see a green zone
Either way the wind blows, I just wanna see my queen grow

I.M.P. business, bitch you know
Family first till the end of the road
I got shooters, I got looters, I got hoes
All around the motherfucking globe
First class flights, helluva life
Bark, bark, bark, helluva bite
Even in hell, taking no L's, never a loss
Counting money 'til I die, helluva boss

Woo yeah
Love, mee, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Love, mee

Now everybody move left, right, left, right, left, right
Now everybody move left, right, left, right, get the fuck out my sight
Now everybody move left, right, left, right, left, right
Now everybody move left, right, left, right, get the fuck out my sight
